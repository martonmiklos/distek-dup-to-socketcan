# What is it?

Distek offers a "Windows Test Client" [here](https://sites.google.com/view/vtanywhere/downloads?authuser=0)

As the description says it is working with UDP multicast mode. 

Their UDP protocol documented [here](https://sites.google.com/view/vtanywhere/configuration?authuser=0)

The tool runs fine with wine, so I wanted to test it with IsoAgVT so I created this script to translate between the UDP and the virtual socketcan interface.
